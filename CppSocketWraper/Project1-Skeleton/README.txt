This is the basic implementation of our chat client and server. We didn't make anywhere near the progress we had been hoping to make, unfortunately between balancing other classes, working full time, and family issues we were only able to implement very basic functionality. We are hoping to have a better working model for the next assignment. 
To build the program in visual studios there is a file labeled tasks.json in the .vscode folder. There are two lines and one is commented out by default. One line is to build the chatserver and the other line builds the chat client. Build the intial server by insuring the chat client line is commented out and the chat server line is uncommeneted. After the server application has been compiled you can then comment the chatserver line out and uncomment the chat client line. After you build the chat client you will have two files, one named chatServer.out and the other chatClient.out. The chat server can be ran from a linux terminal by navigating to folder were it is stored and runing ./chatSever.out. This will start the server and you should see some prompts indicating the server is running and waiting to accept a socket. The chat client can be ran from a different linux terminal by navigating to the directory were it is stored and then  running ./chatClient.out <IP (default is 127.0.0.1)> <Username> <Port(default should be 2000)>. the supported command are /ping, /time, /ison, /help.
Currently the client does not support client to client communication.
